                <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone 
                    can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps 
                    even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration 
                    of the world around us.

                and experiment with our team of experts.

            <!-- <p>During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where 
                you can join other children your age to go on a journey of 
                discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To 
                find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, 
                send us a message.
