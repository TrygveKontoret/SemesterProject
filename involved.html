            <p>There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations
                 are very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum
                  open and accessible to the whole community. 
            </p>
            <p>You can also support us by donating items of interest to
                 the museum’s collections. If you have some item or collection
                 that you think others would enjoy, please let us know by
                 contacting our Collections Department and they will be able
                 to assist you.

            <h3>Volunteer</h3>
            <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep 
                the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come 
                and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to 
                see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only 
                lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers 
                come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies 
                for the museum.
            </p>
            <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please 
                contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get 
                involved.

            <h3>Internships</h3>
            <p>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun

                Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship 
                at the museum.
