                <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, 
                    but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have 
                    over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of 
                    science to explore. 
                </p>
                <p>Many of these exhibits are designed for 
                    you to interact with and play around to see science come to 
                    life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to 
                    life at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>

            <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 
                ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can 
                see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the
                 various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and 
                 learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars 
                 to travel by.

            <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early
                 Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest
                  exploration of the planets in our solar system.

            <div class="exbox">
            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with
                 the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how 
                 did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of 
                 evolution we have had a framework for exploring and 
                 understanding our place in this world.
            </p>
            <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species
                 we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some
                  time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, 
                  including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of 
                  dinosaurs too.

            <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs
                 in biology are offering us unique insights into the great
                  wonders of the tiny world.
            </p>
            <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and
                 their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth
                  of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits
                   we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some
                    major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin
                     and the first heart transplant.
            </p>
            <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only
                 from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
                  Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                   of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello
